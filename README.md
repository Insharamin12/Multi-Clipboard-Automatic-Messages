# Multi-Clipboard-Automatic-Messages

In this project we simplify repetitive typing tasks with a program that stores and manages multiple phrases for quick access.
It allows users to store and retrieve pre-defined text snippets using keyphrases, streamlining repetitive typing tasks.

# Steps involved: 
1. Program Design and Data Structures
2. Handle Command Line Arguments
3. Copy the Right Phrase

# Usage:

- Run the script using Python 3:
```
python3 mclip.py [keyphrase]
```
- Provide a keyphrase as a command-line argument to copy the corresponding text snippet to the clipboard.

# Modules Used:

- sys: For handling system operations and reading command-line arguments.
- pyperclip: For interacting with the system clipboard.

Note: Ensure that Python 3 is installed on your system and accessible from the command line.
